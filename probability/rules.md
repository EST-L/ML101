# Probability rules

#### Union of events

That's the probability that event A or event B occur\
p(A u B) = p(A) + p(B) - p(A n B)\
if A and B are exclusive, p(A u B) = p(A) + p(B)

#### Intersection of events

That's the probability that event A and event B both occur\
p(A n B) = p(A,B) = p(A) p(B|A)\
If A and B are exclusive, p(A n B) = 0

#### Conditional

#### Marginal distribution

#### Bayes
