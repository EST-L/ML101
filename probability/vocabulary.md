#### 1. mutually exclusive, disjoint

p(A n B) = 0 <=> A and B are disjoint or mutually exclusive.

#### 2. conditional probability

p(A | B)

#### 3. complement
  
p(not A) = 1 - p(A)

#### 4. intersection

p(A n B)

#### 5. union

p(A u B)

#### 6. dependent / independent

If the occurence of A changes the probability of B, then A and B are dependent

#### 7. uniform / degenerate distribution

#### 8. pmf (probability mass function)

The pmf is a function that gives the probability for every value taken by a discrete variable X

#### 9. independence and conditional independence

X ind Y | Z <=> p(X ind Y | Z) = p(X|Z)p(Y|Z)
X is independent of Y sachant Z, if the probability of (X ind Y | Z) can be written as a product of marginals 

X ind Y | Z 
X = it will rain tomorrow
Y = ground is wet
Z = it's raining today

>> The fact that it will rain tomorrow is independent from the fact that the ground is wet sachant que it's raining today
