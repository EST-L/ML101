# Introduction

There are 2 interpretations of probability :

- The frequentist
  Characterized by repeated trials
  
  #### Eg :
  
  If we flip the coin many times, we expect it to land heads about half the time.

- The bayesian
  Characterized by a quantified uncertainty.
  
  #### Eg :
  
  Will the ice cap melt by 2020 ?
  
  The Bayesian interpretation is used to solve Machine Learning problems.
